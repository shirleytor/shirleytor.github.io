    "text": "Methods\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"~/Stats Work/Data Science HW/shirleytor.github.io/animal_prices.csv\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Price_in_Rupees=as.numeric(str_remove_all(Price, \"[,Rs]\")))\nview(data)\nunique&lt;-unique(data[,5])\n\nThe data used for this analysis originates from Ikman.lk, a popular website for buying pets in Sri Lanka. It was collected through a script that compiles data from posts about pet sales (Jayawardena). The dataset itself has eleven variables, with one of them consisting of a url identifier for the post it pertains to. For the purpose of this analysis, only three variables are being examined: pet price, which is a numeric continuous variable, type of animal being sold, which is a categorical variable, and city where the animal is being sold, which is also a categorical variable. Pet price is measured in Rupees, Sri Lanka’s national currency, and is the response variable in this analysis. Type of pet being sold is an explanatory variable that consists of the following pet types: dog, cat, fish, and bird. City where the pet is being sold is also an explanatory variable that consists of the cities of Gampaha, Kandy, and Colombo. In order for all sample groups in this analysis to be balanced, they all have the same sample size of 10 different pet prices. The total sample size across all sample groups is 120 different pet prices. The sample groups were formed by using R to filter for pet prices corresponding to a specific pet type and Sri Lankan city-district. Two random districts corresponding to a specific city were chosen, and the first five prices related to a specific pet from each district were chosen to be part of the city sample. For instance, the first five bird prices from Kadawatha, Gampaha and the first five bird prices from Kiribathgoda, Gampaha were chosen to form the sample corresponding to bird prices in Gampaha. Since the data is ordered randomly and the districts were chosen randomly, there is no bias involved with the selection of the data. Each of these samples is thus random and can be used for inference. Due to the small sample size per sample group, it is unlikely they reflect the actual population of pet prices corresponding to a specific animal in a specific city. The sample size should still be large enough to determine if either factor affects pet price, however.\nData cleaning that samples from city-pet categories with 5 or more observations is performed

In terms of this analysis, that means the variance in pet prices within each subgroup needs to be similar.\n\ninferior_fit &lt;- aov(Price_in_Rupees~Animal_Type + Location, data=combination)\nplot(inferior_fit,which = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach group of points in this figure represents a specific subgroup of pet prices corresponding to a specific type of pet in a specific city. When the spread of points within each subgroup is compared to the spread of them in other subgroups, it is evident that different subgroups have different spreads, meaning they have different variances in pet price.\n\nplot(fit,which = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this figure shows, the variances within each group resemble each other significantly more when prices are interpreted in terms of their square root. Since homoscedasticity is necessary for the F-test, the rest of this analysis will interpret pet prices in terms of their square roots instead of the prices themselves. By making sure that homoscedasticity is met, the potential effects of pet type and location on pet prices can then be seen.\nThe purpose of the ANOVA analysis was to see if either pet type or location individually had an effect on the prices of pets. For this reason, two F-tests were conducted for each possible variable. Each variable was given an alpha value of .025 in order to maintain a family-wise confidence level of 95%. The first F-test consists of mean square pet type divided by mean square error, which is the variance of the mean square-root prices in terms of pet type only for all observations divided by the variance of all residuals given the entire model is used to find the fitted value. This is a measure of the amount of variance in the full model explained by pet type being a factor divided by the variance of the residuals given the full model. If pet type is not a significant factor, the numerator of this value should be approximately equal to one variance, meaning the resulting F-score should be approximately one. The null hypothesis for this test is that pet type is not a significant factor, meaning there would be close to no difference in the mean square root prices per pet type. The p-value for the F-test corresponding to pet-type, however, was lower than .025, meaning this null hypothesis is most likely not true and pet type is a significant factor in this model. A second F-test was also performed to test whether a sale occurring in Gampaha, Kandy, or Colombo influenced square root pet prices; since the test resulted in a p-value greater than .025, the null hypothesis that residing in one of these three cities does not have a significant effect on square root pet prices cannot be dismissed.\n\nplot(TukeyHSD(fit,conf.level=.975,which=\"Animal_Type\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom top to bottom, this figure presents confidence intervals for the following pairwise comparisons: cat-bird, dog-bird, fish-bird, dog-cat, fish-cat, and fish-dog. The family wise confidence level is 97.5% because comparisons concerning pet type all have an alpha value of .025. The confidence intervals for the cat-bird, dog-bird, fish-cat, and fish-dog comparisons do not cover zero, meaning this analysis suggests 97.5% confidence of these pet groups possessing different prices from one another throughout Colombo, Kandy, and Gampaha. Since the dog-cat and fish-bird comparisons cover zero, there does not appear to be a significant difference among both pairs of pet price averages throughout Colombo, Kandy, and Gampaha. Both of these sets of comparisons suggest there is an overall difference in price between mammalian pets and non-mammalian pets among the residents of Colombo, Kandy, and Gampaha, which corresponds to people in all three cities assigning differents levels of value to mammalian and non-mammalian pets. It is also possible that dogs and cats, as the most popular pets worldwide, have significantly higher prices in Colombo, Kandy, and Gampaha than all other pets, including other mammalian ones. In order to determine which hypothesis is accurate, however, more analysis would need to be conducted. Based on this analysis, an appropriate model for predicting the prices of pets in Gampaha, Kandy, and Colombo should consist of the average pet price per species of pet."

    "text": "Conclusions\nThe species of a pet appears to have a significant influence on its pricing in the cities of Gampaha, Kandy, and Colombo. Possible improvements to this analysis involve extending it to more cities in Sri Lanka through the inclusion of other cities or through redoing this analysis under a mixed-effects model. This would be in order to definitively exclude location as an influence on the prices of pets in Sri Lanka. Differences in pricing also seem to be most pronounced between the mammalian and non-mammalian species of the sample analyzed. In order to determine whether this difference is based on the status of a pet as a mammalian or non-mammalian animal, one-way ANOVA could be conducted comparing these two groups of pets."

The dataset used for this analysis can be found here. According to the Tidy Tuesday github page I found it in, it originates from Kaggle and was gathered by Shival Bansal. Here is what he says about the data:\n\nThis dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.\nIn 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.\n\nHere is the data dictionary (sourced from here):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nclass\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nshow_id\ncharacter\nUnique ID for every Movie / Tv Show\n\n\ntype\ncharacter\nIdentifier - A Movie or TV Show\n\n\ntitle\ncharacter\nTitle of the Movie / Tv Show\n\n\ndirector\ncharacter\nDirector of the Movie/Show\n\n\ncast\ncharacter\nActors involved in the movie / show\n\n\ncountry\ncharacter\nCountry where the movie / show was produced\n\n\ndate_added\ncharacter\nDate it was added on Netflix\n\n\nrelease_year\ndouble\nActual Release year of the movie / show\n\n\nrating\ncharacter\nTV Rating of the movie / show\n\n\nduration\ncharacter\nTotal Duration - in minutes or number of seasons\n\n\nlisted_in\ncharacter\nGenre\n\n\ndescription\ncharacter\nSummary description of the film/show\n\n\n\n\nnetflix &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-04-20/netflix_titles.csv')"

As such, I track the number of countries that have attended world fairs from 1851 to 2021 to see how world fairs have evolved in terms of country representation.\n#| '!! shinylive warning !!': |\n#|   shinylive does not work in self-contained HTML documents.\n#|   Please set `embed-resources: false` in your metadata.\n#| fig.alt: \"A scatter plot titled number of countries attending world fair based on year.

    "text": "Introduction\n“Taking the Human Out of the Loop: A Review of Bayesian Optimization” is a paper by Shahriari et al. that highlights the concepts and methods underpinning Bayesian Optimization and its applications. It first delves into the general concepts and methods behind Bayesian Optimization before delving into specific implementations of it for specific models. In general, Bayesian Optimization is a sequential method for estimating the optimal parameters of a model. Of interest are some unknown objective function, \\(f\\), and some \\(x*\\) such that $x* = $arg max \\(f(x)\\). \\(x\\) is an element of a parameter space \\(X\\) of interest. We also consider an observation \\(y\\) that is obtained from evaluating \\(f(x)\\). It is assumed to have been produced via a stochastic process involving \\(f(x)\\) in which \\(E(y|f(x)) = f(x)\\).\nIn Bayesian optimization, one initially starts off with a prior describing beliefs over what \\(f\\) might be and is interested in gaining a posterior that more accurately describes what \\(f\\) might be via sequential updates. In order to update the posterior, an acquisition function \\(\\alpha\\) is used at the \\(n\\)th iteration to find a value \\(x_{n+1}\\) that that maximizes it. At this same iteration, \\(x_{n+1}\\) is then used to query a objective function \\(f_n\\), the function most likely to be \\(f\\) based on the version of the posterior at the \\(n\\)th iteration, for an observation \\(y_n\\). Based on this new observation, the posterior is updated and used to determine \\(f_{n+1}\\).\nBayesian optimization can be used in a variety of settings and can be applied to both parametric and nonparametric models. This project will consider the parametric Bernoulli setting, in which a beta prior and a binomial likelihood are used. More specifically, it will implement the algorithm of Thompson Sampling for Beta Bernoulli Bandit as defined in section A of section II of Shahriari et al.(2016)."

    "text": "Thompson Sampling for Beta Bernoulli Bandit\nSuppose we have \\(k\\) Bernoulli parameters of interest corresponding to \\(k\\) objects of interest. Define an object of interest as \\(a \\in 1,2,...k\\). A bernoulli observation \\(y_i \\in\\){\\(0,1\\)} has a mean \\(f(a_i)\\) if observed repeatedly and given it was based on object \\(a_i\\). Let the Bernoulli parameters corresponding to each object be \\(\\theta_1,\\theta_2,...\\theta_k\\) and consider the vector \\(\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R^k}\\) which has all \\(k\\) Bernoulli parameters as scalars. Then a beta prior for \\(\\theta\\) can be defined as \\[p(\\theta|\\alpha,\\beta)= \\prod_{i=1}^{k} beta(\\theta_i | \\alpha_i, \\beta_i)\\]\nin which \\(beta(\\theta_i | \\alpha_i, \\beta_i)\\) is the beta prior for parameter \\(\\theta_i\\).

This is especially true for diseases such as cancer which are almost exclusively thought of in biological terms by the general population; however, it has been known for quite some time within the field of public health that biology does not encompass the entirety of many diseases and their severity. There are many diseases for which social circumstances determine risk of mortality to such a significant degree that social interventions are thought to be a means of decreasing risk (Wender). In cancer specifically, social determinants of health play a significant role in determining the risk of death (Pinheiro). \nNarrowing down these social determinants of health could allow for the implementation of more targeted and cost-effective social interventions that decrease mortality in cancer patients. For this reason, this analysis asks the following question: which social determinants of health are significant enough to cohesively model mortality rates in cancer patients? This will be done by developing a model that conveys the relationship from 2011-2016 between cancer death rates in different US counties and measures related to their differing social circumstances.\n\n\nMethods\nThe data itself was compiled and joined together from clinicaltrials.gov, cancer.gov, and census.gov. It consists of 34 variables, 32 of which were considered as possible explanatory variables and 1, the cancer death rate per county, which was used as the responsive variable. The variables excluded from the analysis were the county variable, which names the United States county each entry of data pertains to, avgAnnCount, avgDeathsPerYear, popEst2015, medianAge, medianAgeFemale, medianAgeMale, binnedInc, studyPerCap and incidenceRate. Since county name is an identifier variable rather than a social variable, I felt it appropriate to exclude it from the analysis. All of these variables were not directly related to social circumstances. Predictably, these were positively correlated to the rate of cancer mortality and revealed nothing insightful about possible interventions. All the variables included in the analysis are continuous numeric variable. There are 591 data points, making this dataset’s sample size very well suited for analysis. Since the data was compiled from government sources, the sampling methods used most likely ensure every observation is independent of each other, which meets one important assumption of regression; however, since the data per county was compiled from different sources, it is possible that slight differences in how each source obtained its data mean that different variables do not correspond perfectly to each other. For instance, without clear insight into how each source defined specific counties, it might be the case that different variables collected data on differently defined counties. In addition, the population estimate for each county is from 2015, while the dataset overall contains data from 2011-2016. Despite these small discrepancies, both the standardization of methods that government agencies tend to implement across all their studies and unlikelihood of any data being extremely different from year to year means the data should be an approximate representation of each county from 2011-2016, thus making it useful for inference about the relationship between US cancer mortality and social factors in this time period.\nThe code used to clean and organize the original dataset is shown below:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(glmnet)\n\n\ncancer &lt;- read.csv(\"~/Stats Work/Data Science HW/shirleytor.github.io/cancer_reg.csv\") %&gt;%\n  clean_names() %&gt;%\n  select(-avg_ann_count,-incidence_rate, -pop_est2015, -study_per_cap, -binned_inc, -median_age, -avg_deaths_per_year, -median_age_male, -median_age_female, -geography) %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\n\n\nData Analysis\n\n#xs &lt;- cancer %&gt;%\n # select(-target_death_rate) %&gt;%\n # as.matrix()\n#for (i in 1:ncol(xs)) {\n # for (j in i:(ncol(xs) + 1)) {\n #   xs &lt;- cbind(xs,xs[,i]*xs[,j])\n # }\n#}\n#y &lt;- cancer %&gt;%\n#  select(target_death_rate)\n#cv1 &lt;- cv.glmnet(xs, y, relax=TRUE)\n#fit.lasso &lt;- glmnet(xs, y, lambda=cv1$relaxed$lambda.1se, relax=TRUE)\n#fit.lasso"

    "text": "I plan to query data from the Wideband Acoustic Immittance Database, which is a repository of auditory measurements from different people. From this data, two graphs will be generated. One graph will be an interactive Shiny version of Figure 1 from Voss(2019) and the other will compare mean absorbance measurements between babies of different sexes over different frequencies using data from Aithal et al.(2013).\nThis is the abstract of Aithal et al.(2013):\n\nPresently, normative wideband reflectance data are available for neonates who have passed a distortion product otoacoustic emission test. However, passing the distortion product otoacoustic emission test alone does not ensure normal middle ear function. The objective of this study was to establish normative wideband reflectance data in healthy neonates with normal middle ear function, as justified by passing a battery of tests.\n\nVoss(2019) is a summarization of different studies analyzing auditory measurements among people.\n\nlibrary(RMariaDB)\nlibrary(dbplyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\ncon_wai &lt;- dbConnect(\n  MariaDB(), host = \"scidb.smith.edu\",\n  user = \"waiuser\", password = \"smith_waiDB\", \n  dbname = \"wai\"\n)\nMeasurements &lt;- tbl(con_wai, \"Measurements\")\nPI_Info &lt;- tbl(con_wai, \"PI_Info\")\nSubjects &lt;- tbl(con_wai, \"Subjects\")\n\n\nSELECT Measurements.Identifier,\n       Measurements.Frequency,\n       AVG(Absorbance) AS mean_absorbance,\n       CONCAT(PI_Info.AuthorsShortList,\" (\", PI_Info.Year, \")\",\" N=\", COUNT(DISTINCT Measurements.SubjectNumber) ,\"; \",Measurements.Instrument) AS studies\nFROM Measurements\nJOIN PI_Info ON Measurements.Identifier = PI_Info.Identifier\nWHERE PI_Info.AuthorsShortList IN (\"Abur et al.\", \"Feeney et al.\", \"Groon et al.\", \"Lewis and Neely\", \"Liu et al.\", \"Rosowski et al.\", \"Shahnaz et al.\", \"Shaver and Sun\", \"Sun et al.\", \"Voss and Allen\", \"Voss et al.\", \"Werner et al.\") AND Measurements.Frequency BETWEEN 0 and 8000\nGROUP BY Measurements.Identifier, Measurements.Frequency,  Measurements.Instrument;\n\n\n# Code to convert SQL table to csv file that can be used in Shiny app\ntf &lt;- cat(NULL,file=\"tf.csv\")\nwrite.csv(table1, file=\"tf.csv\")\n\n#| '!! shinylive warning !!': |\n#|   shinylive does not work in self-contained HTML documents.\n#|   Please set `embed-resources: false` in your metadata.\n#| fig.alt: \"A line plot titled mean absorbance from publications in WAI database.
